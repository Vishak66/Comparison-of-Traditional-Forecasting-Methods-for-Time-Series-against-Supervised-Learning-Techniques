# Comparison-of-Traditional-Forecasting-Methods-for-Time-Series-against-Supervised-Learning-Techniques
In the last few decades many methods have become available for forecasting. As always, when alternatives exist, choices need to be made so that an appropriate forecasting method can be selected and used for the specific situation being considered. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the popular linear models in time series forecasting during the past three decades. Recent research activities in forecasting with supervised machine learning techniques can be a promising alternative to the traditional linear methods. In this project we have compared various techniques against the widely used method (ARIMA) for multiple datasets and compared the results.
